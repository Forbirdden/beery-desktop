# What is beery Desktop?
beery Desktop is an desktop app for app store created out of boredom and "I can do it"

beery gets programs directly from their github repositories, so I won't get sued for copyright infringement (I hope)

If you want to add your (or not so) program to beery, feel free to [make a pull request](https://github.com/Forbirdden/beery/pulls) with an updated repos.json
